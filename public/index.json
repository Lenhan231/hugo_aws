	"content": "Accelerate Your Data and AI Flow by Connecting Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio to Visual Studio Code by Lauren Mullennex, Anagha Barve, Anchit Gupta, and Bhargava Varadharajan — September 12, 2025 · Amazon SageMaker AI · Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio · Announcements · Intermediate (200) · Technical How-to\nDevelopers and machine learning (ML) engineers can now connect their local Visual Studio Code (VS Code) editor directly to Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio. This capability lets you preserve your existing development workflow and personalized integrated development environment (IDE) configuration while still taking advantage of AWS analytics and AI/ML services in a single, unified data-and-AI studio. The integration provides seamless access from your laptop to scalable infrastructure for data processing, SQL analytics, and ML workloads. By linking your local IDE to SageMaker Unified Studio, you can optimize data and AI development pipelines without disrupting the best practices already in place.\nIn this post, we show how to connect your local copy of VS Code to SageMaker Unified Studio so you can build end-to-end data and AI workflows while continuing to work from your favorite IDE.\nSolution overview The architecture relies on three core components:\nLocal workstation – Your development machine runs VS Code with the AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio Code and Microsoft Remote SSH installed. Use the Toolkit extension to browse SageMaker Unified Studio spaces and select the environment you want to work in. SageMaker Unified Studio – As part of the next generation of Amazon SageMaker, Unified Studio is a single experience where you can find and access your data, then work with familiar AWS tools for SQL analytics, data preparation, model development, and generative-AI application development. AWS Systems Manager – A secure, scalable remote-access and management service that links your local VS Code environment to SageMaker Unified Studio spaces and streamlines your data and AI workflows. The diagram below shows how your local IDE interacts with SageMaker Unified Studio spaces.\nPrerequisites To try the remote IDE experience, make sure you have:\nAccess to a SageMaker Unified Studio domain with internet connectivity. For domains configured in VPC-only mode, the domain must reach the internet through a proxy or NAT gateway. If your domain is completely isolated, follow the remote IDE support guide. You can create a domain via the quick setup or manual setup workflow. An SSO user authenticated through IAM Identity Center. See the user management documentation to configure SSO access. Access to, or the ability to create, a SageMaker Unified Studio project. A compute space (JupyterLab or Code Editor) with at least 8 GB of memory. In this walkthrough we use an ml.t3.large instance. SageMaker Distribution image version 2.8 or later is supported. The latest stable build of VS Code on your local machine with Microsoft Remote SSH (version 0.74.0 or later) and the AWS Toolkit extension (version 3.74.0). Implement the solution Complete the following steps to enable remote access and connect to a space from VS Code. A SageMaker Unified Studio space must have remote access turned on before you can reach it from your IDE.\nOpen your JupyterLab or Code Editor space. If it is already running, stop the space and choose Configure space so you can enable remote access. Turn on Remote access and choose Save and restart. In your local VS Code, open the AWS Toolkit pane. On the SageMaker Unified Studio tab, choose Sign in, then supply your domain URL, for example https://\u0026lt;domain-id\u0026gt;.sagemaker.\u0026lt;region\u0026gt;.on.aws. You are redirected to a browser to authorize the AWS IDE extensions. Choose Open to launch the new browser tab. Choose Allow access so the extensions can reach your project from VS Code. When you see Request approved, you have remote access to the domain. Return to your local VS Code window to keep working on ETL jobs, data pipelines, ML training and deployment, or generative-AI applications. To connect to a project for data processing and ML development, perform these steps:\nChoose Select a project to view data assets and compute resources. All projects in the domain are listed, but you can only open the projects where you are a member.\nYou can view only one domain and one project at a time. To switch projects or sign out of the domain, select the ellipsis icon. You can also review the data and compute resources you created earlier. Connect to a JupyterLab or Code Editor space by choosing the connect icon. If the icon is hidden, remote access might be disabled for that space. If the space status is “Stopped,” hover over it and choose connect—this enables remote access, starts the space, and opens the connection. If the space is “Running,” stop it, enable remote access, and reconnect from the Toolkit.\nVS Code opens a second window that connects to your SageMaker Unified Studio space over remote SSH. Go to Explorer to see the notebooks, files, and scripts inside the space. From the AWS Toolkit you can also browse the data sources that belong to the project.\nUse your custom VS Code setup with SageMaker Unified Studio resources When VS Code connects to SageMaker Unified Studio, you keep all of your personal hotkeys, settings, and snippets. If you rely on snippets to insert common analytics or ML patterns, they continue to work while you run on SageMaker Unified Studio’s managed infrastructure.\nIn the following example we run analytics snippets: show-databases queries Amazon Athena to list available databases, show-glue-tables lists the tables stored in the AWS Glue Data Catalog, and query-ecommerce uses Spark SQL to fetch data for analysis.\nYou can also use snippets to automate ML model builds and training on SageMaker AI. The screenshot below shows snippets that handle data processing, configure training, and launch a SageMaker AI training job. This approach lets data practitioners keep their familiar dev setup while tapping into the managed data and AI resources inside SageMaker Unified Studio.\nDisable remote access in SageMaker Unified Studio If you are an administrator and need to disable this feature, add the following policy statement to the project’s IAM role:\n{ \u0026#34;Version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2012-10-17\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Statement\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;Sid\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;DenyStartSessionForSpaces\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Effect\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Deny\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Action\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;sagemaker:StartSession\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;Resource\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;arn:aws:sagemaker:*:*:space/*/*\u0026#34; } ] } Clean up By default, SageMaker Unified Studio stops idle resources such as JupyterLab and Code Editor spaces after 1 hour. If you created a dedicated SageMaker Unified Studio domain just for this walkthrough, remember to delete the domain when you finish.\nConclusion Connecting your local IDE directly to Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio eliminates the friction of jumping between on-device development and scalable data-and-AI infrastructure. Because you keep your personalized IDE configuration, you no longer need to switch mindsets between environments. Whether you are processing large datasets, training foundation models, or building generative-AI applications, you can remain in your local setup while accessing all of SageMaker Unified Studio’s capabilities. Connect your IDE to SageMaker Unified Studio today to streamline data workflows and speed up ML development.\nAbout the authors Lauren Mullennex\rLauren is a Senior Specialist Solutions Architect for GenAI/ML at AWS.

A VPC exists within a single Region. When creating a VPC, you must define an IPv4 CIDR block (required) and optionally an IPv6 one. The default limit is 5 VPCs per Region per Account. Commonly used to separate environments such as Production, Development, and Staging. To achieve full resource isolation, use separate AWS Accounts rather than multiple VPCs. Subnets A subnet resides within one Availability Zone. The subnet CIDR must be a subset of the parent VPC\u0026rsquo;s CIDR block. AWS reserves 5 IP addresses in each subnet: network, broadcast, router, DNS, and future use. Reserved IP Addresses Example (10.0.0.0/24):\n10.0.0.0 - Network address 10.0.0.1 - VPC router 10.0.0.2 - DNS server 10.0.0.3 - Reserved for future use 10.0.0.255 - Broadcast address Hands-On Labs Lab 03 – Amazon VPC \u0026amp; Networking Basics Create VPC → 03-03.1 Create Subnet → 03-03.2 "

Sessions A session spans from the moment a client connects to the DBMS until the connection is terminated. Primary Key A primary key uniquely identifies each row in a relational table. Foreign Key A foreign key in one table references the primary key of another table, creating a relationship between them. Index An index accelerates data retrieval at the cost of extra writes and storage to maintain the index structure. Indexes locate data without scanning every row; they can be defined over one or more columns. Index Types:\nB-Tree: General purpose, balanced tree structure Hash: Fast equality lookups Bitmap: Efficient for low-cardinality columns Full-Text: Text search optimization Partitioning Partitioning splits a large table into smaller, independent pieces (partitions), potentially placed on different storage. Benefits: better query performance, easier maintenance, and scalability. Common types: Range (e.g., by date) List Hash Composite (combination) Partitioning Example:\n-- Range partitioning by date CREATE TABLE orders ( order_id INT, order_date DATE, amount DECIMAL ) PARTITION BY RANGE (YEAR(order_date)) ( PARTITION p2023 VALUES LESS THAN (2024), PARTITION p2024 VALUES LESS THAN (2025), PARTITION p2025 VALUES LESS THAN (2026) ); Execution Plan / Query Plan A query plan details how the DBMS will execute an SQL statement (access paths, joins, sorts). Types: Estimated plan (before execution) Actual plan (from executed query) Key operators: table scan, index seek/scan, nested loops, hash/merge join, sort, aggregate, filter. Database Logs Database logs record all changes (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) and operations. Typical log types: transaction, redo, undo, binary logs. Uses: recovery, integrity, consistency/durability (ACID), replication, performance analysis. Buffers A buffer pool caches pages read from disk to minimize I/O. Management strategies: Replacement: LRU, FIFO, Clock Write policies: immediate vs. deferred Prefetching to warm the cache Hands-On Labs Lab 05 – Amazon RDS \u0026amp; EC2 Integration (Part 1) Create a VPC → 05-2.1 Create EC2 Security Group → 05-2.2 Create RDS Security Group → 05-2.3 Create DB Subnet Group → 05-2.4 "

Approach: adopt a Vertical Slice Architecture so every slice is built as a complete feature instead of layer-by-layer. Benefits: immediate demos, earlier bug discovery, and tighter coordination between frontend and backend. Slice Architecture User → Frontend → API → Database → Response → UI Each slice bundles UI, API contracts, backend logic, and demo data. Components can be swapped independently without breaking the rest of the system. Vertical Slice Architecture Core Principles Build features around the user journey instead of isolated layers. Keep the scope tight so each slice can demo quickly and gather feedback. Define slice ownership clearly to ease future extensions. Benefits Accelerates value delivery—you can show stakeholders right away. Lowers integration risk because every slice self-validates. Enables multiple slices to progress in parallel. Key Insights Vertical slices act as the foundation before expanding to additional features. Each slice needs a clear checklist (finished UI, validated contract, accurate backend responses). Treat every slice like a “mini product” with its own lifecycle to keep quality high. Hands-On Labs Define the scope of slice 0 (book-detail flow, minimum viable data). Draw the data-flow diagram and nail down the frontend/backend boundary. Standardize the demo checklist (contract, mock, UI, backend). "

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, generate, and interact with human language.\nNLP integrates computational linguistics, machine learning, and deep learning to process large-scale text and speech data.\nTypical NLP Tasks: Text classification Sentiment analysis Named Entity Recognition (NER) Machine translation Part-of-speech (POS) tagging Speech recognition Core Linguistic Components in NLP Phonetics – The Sounds of Human Speech Phonetics studies the physical properties of speech sounds.\nThree Branches: Articulatory phonetics: how sounds are produced (tongue, lips, vocal folds…) Acoustic phonetics: physical sound properties (frequency, amplitude, duration) Auditory phonetics: how humans perceive sounds NLP Relevance: Used in speech recognition, speech synthesis (TTS), acoustic modeling.\nPhonology – Sound Systems of Languages Phonology studies how sounds function within a particular language. It deals with phonemes, stress patterns, allowable sound combinations.\nNLP Relevance: Grapheme-to-phoneme conversion, pronunciation modeling.\nMorphology – Structure of Words Morphology studies how words are formed from smaller units called morphemes.\nExamples: Prefixes: un-, re-, pre- Suffixes: -ing, -ed, -ness Roots/stems: run, happy, form NLP Relevance:\nStemming Lemmatization Tokenization Vocabulary building for BoW models NLP Applications Search Engines Your daily searches in the search engines are facilitated by NLP for query understanding and result ranking.\nSearch Intent Recognition Example When someone searches for \u0026ldquo;glass coffee tables\u0026rdquo;, the intent engine determines that the word \u0026ldquo;glass\u0026rdquo; likely refers to the value of attribute \u0026lsquo;Top Material\u0026rsquo; in coffee tables. It then directs the search engine accordingly to show the coffee tables category with the \u0026lsquo;Top Material\u0026rsquo; attribute set to \u0026lsquo;glass\u0026rsquo;.\nOnline Advertising NLP enables targeted ads by analyzing online behavior through multiple components:\n1. Named Entity Recognizer (NER) Identifies selected information elements called Named Entities (NE). Due to unavailability of labeled data, semi-supervised approaches are adapted to detect project use-case specific entities.\n2. Relationship Extraction One of the classical NLP tasks which aims at extracting semantic relationships from unstructured or semi-structured text documents.\n3. Moment Recognizer (MoRec) Enables analysts to understand forum discussions in the knowledge discovery phase by processing unstructured discussion text and extracting knowledge in terms of events. Events can be defined and configured depending on the use-case under investigation.\nVoice Assistants Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant use NLP to understand and respond to your voice commands.\nMachine Translation Services like Google Translate rely on NLP to convert text from one language to another.\nChatbots Customer service chatbots use NLP to interact with users and provide assistance.\nText Summarization NLP algorithms can condense long articles into brief summaries.\n"

	"content": "Date: 2025-11-03 (Monday)\nStatus: \u0026ldquo;Done\u0026rdquo;\nThe Problem with RNNs: Sequential Processing Bottleneck RNNs have dominated NLP for years, but they have fundamental limitations that transformers solve. Let\u0026rsquo;s explore these issues.\nProblem 1: Sequential Computation How RNNs Process Information RNNs must process inputs one step at a time, sequentially:\nTranslation Example (English → French):\nInput: \u0026#34;I am happy\u0026#34;\rTime Step 1: Process \u0026#34;I\u0026#34;\rTime Step 2: Process \u0026#34;am\u0026#34; Time Step 3: Process \u0026#34;happy\u0026#34; Impact:\nIf your sentence has 5 words → 5 sequential steps required If your sentence has 1000 words → 1000 sequential steps required Cannot parallelize! Must wait for step t-1 before computing step t Why This Matters Modern GPUs and TPUs are designed for parallel computation Sequential RNNs cannot take advantage of this parallelization Training becomes much slower than necessary Longer sequences = exponentially longer training time Problem 2: Vanishing Gradient Problem The Root Cause When RNNs backpropagate through many time steps, gradients get multiplied repeatedly:\nGradient Flow Through T Steps:\n∂Loss/∂h₀ = ∂Loss/∂hₜ × (∂hₜ/∂hₜ₋₁) × (∂hₜ₋₁/∂hₜ₋₂) × ... × (∂h₁/∂h₀) If each ∂hᵢ/∂hᵢ₋₁ \u0026lt; 1 (which it often is):\nAfter T multiplications: gradient ≈ 0.5^100 ≈ 0 (for T=100) Gradient vanishes to zero Model can\u0026rsquo;t learn long-range dependencies Concrete Example Sentence: \u0026ldquo;The students who studied hard\u0026hellip; passed the exam\u0026rdquo;\nEarly word \u0026ldquo;students\u0026rdquo; needs to influence prediction of \u0026ldquo;passed\u0026rdquo; But gradient has vanished by the time it reaches \u0026ldquo;students\u0026rdquo; Model fails to learn this relationship! Current Workarounds LSTMs and GRUs help a little with gates, but:\nStill have issues with very long sequences (\u0026gt;100-200 words) Cannot fully solve the problem Still require sequential processing Problem 3: Information Bottleneck The Compression Issue Sequence-to-Sequence Architecture:\nEncoder: Word₁ → h₁ → h₂ → h₃ → hₜ (final hidden state)\rDecoder: hₜ → Word₁\u0026#39; → Word₂\u0026#39; → Word₃\u0026#39; → ... The Bottleneck: All information from the entire input sequence is compressed into a single vector hₜ (the final hidden state).\nWhy This Fails Example Sentence: \u0026ldquo;The government of the United States of America announced\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nWhen encoding this 8-word sentence:\nFirst word \u0026ldquo;The\u0026rdquo; is processed Information flows through states: h₁ → h₂ → h₃ → \u0026hellip; → h₈ By h₈, information about \u0026ldquo;The\u0026rdquo; has been diluted/lost Only h₈ is passed to decoder Decoder has limited context about early words The Consequence Long sequences lose information Important early context gets diluted Model struggles with long documents Translation quality degrades for long sentences Summary: Why RNNs Have Fundamental Issues Issue Impact Current Solution Sequential Processing Cannot parallelize, slow training N/A - Fundamental to RNN design Vanishing Gradients Can\u0026rsquo;t learn long-range dependencies LSTM/GRU gates (partial fix) Information Bottleneck Early information gets lost Attention mechanism (partial fix) The Transformer Solution: \u0026ldquo;Attention is All You Need\u0026rdquo; Introduced in 2017 by Google researchers (Vaswani et al.), transformers completely replace RNNs with attention mechanisms.\nKey Differences Aspect RNNs Transformers Processing Sequential (one word at a time) Parallel (all words at once) Dependency Each word depends on previous state All words attend to all words Training Speed Slow (sequential) Fast (parallel) Long Sequences Vanishing gradients No sequential bottleneck Long-range Deps. Difficult Easy (direct attention) How Transformers Work (Brief Overview) No RNN: Remove sequential hidden states completely Pure Attention: Let each word \u0026ldquo;attend to\u0026rdquo; every other word Positional Encoding: Add position information since we don\u0026rsquo;t have sequential order Parallel Processing: Process entire sequence at once Example:\nSentence: \u0026#34;I am happy\u0026#34;\rInstead of:\rStep 1: Process \u0026#34;I\u0026#34; → h₁\rStep 2: Process \u0026#34;am\u0026#34; with h₁ → h₂\rStep 3: Process \u0026#34;happy\u0026#34; with h₂ → h₃\rTransformer Does:\rParallel: \u0026#34;I\u0026#34; attends to {\u0026#34;I\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;am\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;happy\u0026#34;}\rParallel: \u0026#34;am\u0026#34; attends to {\u0026#34;I\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;am\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;happy\u0026#34;}\rParallel: \u0026#34;happy\u0026#34; attends to {\u0026#34;I\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;am\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;happy\u0026#34;}\rAll at once! Why Everyone Talks About Transformers Speed: Can train much faster on GPUs/TPUs (parallel) Scalability: Can handle very long sequences (no bottleneck) Long-range: Direct attention solves gradient problems Versatility: Works for translation, classification, QA, summarization, chatbots\u0026hellip; Performance: Achieves state-of-the-art on nearly every NLP task\nApplications of Transformers Transformers are used for:\nTranslation (Neural Machine Translation) - High quality, fast Text Summarization (Abstractive \u0026amp; Extractive) Named Entity Recognition (NER) - Identify entities better Question Answering - Understand context better Chatbots \u0026amp; Voice Assistants Sentiment Analysis - Understand emotion/opinion Auto-completion - Smart suggestions Classification - Classify text into categories Market Intelligence - Analyze market sentiment State-of-the-Art Transformer Models GPT-2 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) Created by: OpenAI Type: Decoder-only transformer Speciality: Text generation Famous for: Generating human-like text (even fooled journalists in 2019!) BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) Created by: Google AI Type: Encoder-only transformer Speciality: Text understanding \u0026amp; representations Use: Classification, NER, QA T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) Created by: Google Type: Full encoder-decoder (like original transformer) Speciality: Multi-task learning Super versatile: Single model handles translation, classification, QA, summarization, regression "

Transfer learning reuses a pre-trained model so you converge faster, get better accuracy, and need less labeled data.\nPipelines Compared Classical: data -\u0026gt; random init model -\u0026gt; train -\u0026gt; predict Transfer: pre-train on large corpus -\u0026gt; reuse weights -\u0026gt; fine-tune on target task -\u0026gt; predict [Large unlabeled/labeled data] --pre-train--\u0026gt; [Base model weights] \\ fine-tune on task data --\u0026gt; deploy Two Approaches Feature-based: treat pre-trained embeddings as fixed features; train a new head. Fine-tuning: update (part of) the base model weights on downstream data. Benefits Checklist Faster convergence because weights are warm-started. Better predictions from richer representations. Smaller labeled datasets needed; leverage unlabeled pre-training. Key Considerations Domain shift: choose pre-training data close to target domain when possible. Catastrophic forgetting: use smaller learning rate or freeze early layers. Evaluation: monitor if freezing vs. full fine-tuning impacts overfitting. Practice Targets for Today Sketch a transfer pipeline for your QA task (data, base model, head, metrics). Decide which layers to freeze vs. fine-tune. Prepare a small experiment plan comparing feature-based vs. fine-tuned runs. "

	"description": "",
	"content": "Announcing Amazon EC2 M4 and M4 Pro Mac Instances by Sébastien Stormacq — September 12, 2025 · Amazon EC2 Mac Instances · Launch · News · Permalink · Comments\nPermalink Comments Share · Voiced by Polly\nI have used macOS since 2001 and Amazon EC2 Mac instances since they launched four years ago. In that time I have helped many customers scale their continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines on AWS. Today I’m thrilled to share that the M4 and M4 Pro Mac instances are now generally available.\nTeams that build for Apple platforms need powerful compute to handle complex build pipelines and run multiple iOS simulators simultaneously. As projects grow in size and sophistication, they need more performance and memory to keep their development cycles fast.\nApple M4 Mac mini at the core EC2 M4 Mac instances (mac-m4.metal in the API) are based on the Apple M4 Mac mini and run on the AWS Nitro System. They include an Apple silicon M4 with a 10-core CPU (four performance cores and six efficiency cores), a 10-core GPU, a 16-core Neural Engine, and 24 GB of unified memory, delivering up to 20% faster iOS and macOS build performance than EC2 M2 Mac instances.\nEC2 M4 Pro Mac instances (mac-m4pro.metal) use the Apple silicon M4 Pro with a 14-core CPU, 20-core GPU, 16-core Neural Engine, and 48 GB of unified memory. They deliver up to 15% faster build times compared to EC2 M2 Pro Mac instances, and the additional memory and compute let you run more parallel test suites across multiple simulators.\nEach M4 and M4 Pro Mac instance now ships with 2 TB of local NVMe storage, providing low-latency storage to boost caching plus build-and-test performance.\nBoth instance types support macOS Sonoma 15.6 and later as Amazon Machine Images (AMIs). AWS Nitro provides up to 10 Gbps of Amazon VPC network bandwidth and up to 8 Gbps of Amazon EBS bandwidth via high-speed Thunderbolt connections.\nEC2 Mac instances integrate with the rest of AWS, so you can:\nBuild automated CI/CD pipelines with AWS CodeBuild and AWS CodePipeline. Store and manage build secrets—such as Apple developer certificates and keys—in AWS Secrets Manager. Manage your development infrastructure with AWS CloudFormation. Monitor instance performance by using Amazon CloudWatch. How to get started Launch an EC2 M4 or M4 Pro Mac instance with the AWS Management Console, the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or an AWS SDK.\nIn this walkthrough I start an M4 Pro instance from the console. First I allocate a dedicated host. In the AWS Management Console, I open EC2, choose Dedicated Hosts, and select Allocate Dedicated Host.\nNext I add a tag, select the instance family mac-m4pro, and pick the mac-m4pro.metal instance type. I choose an Availability Zone and clear Host maintenance.\nThe console also shows the most recent macOS versions supported on this host family—in this case macOS 15.6.\nOn the Launch an instance page I enter a name, pick a macOS Sequoia AMI, make sure the architecture is 64-bit Arm, and select the mac-m4pro.metal instance type.\nThe remaining parameters are the usual EC2 settings for networking and storage. For development you should provision at least 200 GB; the default 100-GB volume is not enough to download and install Xcode.\nWhen I’m ready, I choose the orange Launch instance button.

If you resize the volume after launch, remember to resize the APFS filesystem. You can also install your tools on the 2-TB internal SSD available in the Mac mini for even lower latency. Note that the contents of this drive are tied to the instance lifecycle, not to the dedicated host, so it is wiped when you stop and start the instance. The mac-m4.metal and mac-m4pro.metal instance types support macOS Sequoia 15.6 and later. You can migrate existing EC2 Mac instances that already run macOS 15 (Sequoia). Create a custom AMI from the current instance and launch an M4 or M4 Pro Mac from that AMI. Finally, here are three guides I wrote to help you get started with EC2 Mac:\nStart an EC2 Mac instance Connect to an EC2 Mac instance (three different connection methods) Build iOS apps faster with a CI/CD pipeline on EC2 Mac Pricing and availability EC2 M4 and M4 Pro Mac instances are available in US East (N. Virginia) and US West (Oregon) today, with additional Regions to follow.\nYou purchase EC2 Mac instances as Dedicated Hosts with On-Demand pricing or Savings Plans. Billing is per second with a 24-hour allocation minimum, in accordance with Apple’s macOS Software License Agreement. After the 24-hour minimum you can release the host at any time with no further commitment.\nAs someone who works closely with Apple developers, I can’t wait to see how you use these new instances to accelerate your build cycles. The combination of higher performance, more memory, and deep AWS integration unlocks fresh possibilities for iOS, macOS, iPadOS, tvOS, watchOS, and visionOS teams. Beyond app development, the Apple Neural Engine makes these instances an efficient option for machine learning (ML) inference workloads. I will cover this topic in more detail at AWS re:Invent 2025, where I’ll share benchmarks and best practices for running ML inference on EC2 Mac.\nAbout the author Sébastien Stormacq\rSeb has been writing code since he first touched a Commodore 64 in the mid-eighties.

Each VPC has a default route table containing only a local route allowing internal communication between subnets. Custom route tables can be created, but the local route cannot be deleted. Elastic Network Interface (ENI) An ENI is a virtual network card that can be moved between EC2 instances. It retains its private IP, Elastic IP address, and MAC address when reassigned. Elastic IP (EIP) is a static public IPv4 address that can be associated with an ENI. Unused EIPs incur charges. ENI Use Cases:\nManagement network separate from data network Network and security appliances Dual-homed instances with workloads on distinct subnets Low-budget, high-availability solution VPC Endpoints A VPC Endpoint enables private connectivity to supported AWS services via AWS PrivateLink without using the public Internet. Two types: Interface Endpoint: Uses an ENI with a private IP. Gateway Endpoint: Uses route tables (available for S3 and DynamoDB only).

When to Use It The first sprint of a vertical slice. Need to showcase a flow without production data yet. Want automated UI tests based on the contract. Operational Notes Run Prism on localhost:4010 and point Next.js to the mock via NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL. Mirror production CORS headers in the mock responses. Always commit the spec before mocking so everyone uses the same version. Hands-On Labs Define the OpenAPI spec for the /books/{id} endpoint. Launch the Prism mock server and verify the UI flow.

gets PE₀ Position 1: \u0026ldquo;am\u0026rdquo; gets PE₁ Position 2: \u0026ldquo;happy\u0026rdquo; gets PE₂ Example:\nEmbedding(\u0026#34;I\u0026#34;) = [0.2, -0.5, 0.8, ..., 0.1]\rPE(pos=0) = [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, ..., 0.5]\rFinal = [0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 1.0, ..., 0.6] Component 3: Multi-Head Attention Instead of one attention mechanism, we have h different \u0026ldquo;heads\u0026rdquo; running in parallel.\nConcept:\nInput: Query (Q), Key (K), Value (V) matrices\rHead 1: ScaledDotProductAttention(Q₁, K₁, V₁)\rHead 2: ScaledDotProductAttention(Q₂, K₂, V₂)\r...\rHead h: ScaledDotProductAttention(Qₕ, Kₕ, Vₕ)\rOutput = Concatenate(Head₁, Head₂, ..., Headₕ) Why Multiple Heads?\nHead 1 might learn \u0026ldquo;subject-verb\u0026rdquo; relationships Head 2 might learn \u0026ldquo;adjective-noun\u0026rdquo; relationships Head 3 might learn \u0026ldquo;pronoun-reference\u0026rdquo; relationships Together: Rich contextual understanding Typical Configuration:\nNumber of heads: 8-16 Dimension per head: 64 (if total = 512, then 512/8 = 64) Component 4: Residual Connections \u0026amp; Layer Normalization Residual Connections Output = Input + Attention(Input) This helps with gradient flow during training and allows networks to go deeper.\nLayer Normalization Normalized = (x - mean) / sqrt(variance + epsilon) Stabilizes training and speeds up convergence.\nComponent 5: Feed-Forward Network After attention, there\u0026rsquo;s a simple 2-layer feed-forward network:\nOutput = ReLU(Linear₁(x)) → Linear₂ Typical dimensions:\nInput: [batch_size, seq_length, 512]\r↓ Linear₁ (512 → 2048)\r[batch_size, seq_length, 2048]\r↓ ReLU (non-linear)\r[batch_size, seq_length, 2048]\r↓ Linear₂ (2048 → 512)\r[batch_size, seq_length, 512] This expands then contracts, allowing for non-linear transformations.\nThe Encoder: Detailed View Single Encoder Layer:\nInput (x)\r↓\r[Multi-Head Self-Attention]\r↓\r[+ Residual Connection with input]\r↓\r[Layer Normalization]\r↓\r[Feed-Forward Network]\r↓\r[+ Residual Connection]\r↓\r[Layer Normalization]\r↓\rOutput Key Point: In encoder, each word attends to ALL words (including itself) in the same sentence.\nEncoder gives: Contextual representation of each word, considering all other words.\nThe Decoder: Detailed View Decoder is similar but with masking:\nInput (shifted right by 1)\r↓\r[Masked Multi-Head Self-Attention] ← Can only attend to previous positions\r↓\r[+ Residual + LayerNorm]\r↓\r[Encoder-Decoder Attention] ← Attends to encoder output\r↓\r[+ Residual + LayerNorm]\r↓\r[Feed-Forward Network]\r↓\r[+ Residual + LayerNorm]\r↓\rOutput Three Attention Mechanisms in Decoder:\nMasked Self-Attention:\nQueries, Keys, Values from decoder Each position can only attend to previous positions Prevents information leakage (decoder doesn\u0026rsquo;t see future words) Encoder-Decoder Attention:\nQueries from decoder Keys, Values from encoder Decoder can attend to any encoder position Feed-Forward:\nSame 2-layer network as encoder Putting It Together: Full Transformer Training Phase Input: \u0026#34;Je suis heureux\u0026#34; (French)\rTarget: \u0026#34;I am happy\u0026#34; (English)\rEncoder Input:\r- Tokenize: [Je, suis, heureux]\r- Embed each token\r- Add positional encoding\r- Process through N encoder layers\r→ Output: C (context vectors)\rDecoder Input:\r- Target shifted right: [\u0026lt;START\u0026gt;, I, am]\r- Embed each token\r- Add positional encoding\r- Process through N decoder layers\r- Using masked self-attention\r- Using encoder-decoder attention on C\r→ Output logits for each position\rLoss: Compare predicted \u0026#34;am happy\u0026#34; with actual \u0026#34;am happy\u0026#34;\rBackprop: Update all weights Inference Phase Encoder Input: [Je, suis, heureux]\r→ Output: C (context vectors)\rDecoder:\rStep 1: Start with [\u0026lt;START\u0026gt;]\rPredict next word: \u0026#34;I\u0026#34;\rStep 2: [\u0026lt;START\u0026gt;, I] Predict next word: \u0026#34;am\u0026#34;\rStep 3: [\u0026lt;START\u0026gt;, I, am]\rPredict next word: \u0026#34;happy\u0026#34;\rStep 4: [\u0026lt;START\u0026gt;, I, am, happy]\rPredict next word: \u0026lt;END\u0026gt;\rOutput: \u0026#34;I am happy\u0026#34; Summary: Why This Architecture Works Feature Benefit No RNN Fully parallelizable - train on GPUs efficiently Self-Attention in Encoder Each word gets context from ALL other words Masked Attention in Decoder Can\u0026rsquo;t see future - trains with autoregressive generation Positional Encoding Preserves word order without RNN sequential processing Multi-Head Attention Learn multiple types of relationships simultaneously Residual Connections Gradient flow - enables training deep networks Layer Normalization Stability - faster convergence Key Innovations Parallelization: O(1) depth instead of O(n) for RNNs Long-range Dependencies: Attention can directly connect any two positions Scalability: Can increase model size with predictable improvements Transfer Learning: Pre-trained transformers (BERT, GPT) work across tasks "

Output: span extraction or short generation grounded in context. Training: supervised spans (e.g., start/end indices) or seq2seq with context. Failure mode: wrong or missing span when context is noisy. Closed-Book Input: question only; the model must rely on internal knowledge. Output: generated answer without explicit context. Training: language modeling style on large corpora; often fine-tuned on QA pairs. Failure mode: hallucination; mitigated by stronger pre-training and knowledge distillation. Picking the Mode If you can supply documents at runtime -\u0026gt; prefer context-based (more controllable, cite-able). If latency/storage prevents retrieving context -\u0026gt; closed-book is lighter but riskier. Evaluation Notes Context-based: exact match / F1 over spans; check grounding to provided text. Closed-book: BLEU/ROUGE and human factuality checks; add retrieval if drift is high. Practice Targets for Today Draft examples for both modes using your domain data. Define metrics you will track (span EM/F1 vs. generative ROUGE/factuality). List retrieval options to upgrade closed-book to open-book if needed. "

	"content": "AWS GenAI Builder Club: AI-Driven Development Life Cycle - Reimagining Software Engineering Date \u0026amp; Time: Friday, October 3, 2025 | 14:00 (2:00 PM)\nLocation: AWS Event Hall, L26 Bitexco Tower, Ho Chi Minh City\nInstructors: Toan Huynh \u0026amp; My Nguyen\nCoordinators: Diem My, Dai Truong, Dinh Nguyen\nEvent Overview This AWS GenAI Builder Club session explored the AI-Driven Development Lifecycle (AI-DLC), a transformative approach to software engineering that integrates AI as a central collaborator throughout the entire development process. The session featured hands-on demonstrations of Amazon Q Developer and Kiro, showcasing practical applications of AI in modern software development.\nAgenda Time Session Instructor 14:00 - 14:15 Welcoming - 14:15 - 15:30 AI-Driven Development Life Cycle Overview \u0026amp; Amazon Q Developer Demonstration Toan Huynh 15:30 - 15:45 Break - 15:45 - 16:30 Kiro Demonstration My Nguyen Key Concepts \u0026amp; Learnings 1. AI-Driven Development Lifecycle (AI-DLC) Overview Core Philosophy The AI-Driven Development Lifecycle represents a fundamental shift in how software is built. Rather than treating AI as an afterthought or simple code completion tool, AI-DLC embeds AI as an intelligent partner throughout the entire development process.\nKey Principles:\nYou Are in Control - AI is your assistant, not your manager. You must maintain decision-making authority over the project direction and implementation details.\nAI as Collaborator, Not Replacement - AI should ask critical questions about your project requirements, architecture, and goals. The collaboration should be bidirectional, with you guiding the AI\u0026rsquo;s suggestions.\nPlan Before Implementation - Always create a comprehensive plan before diving into code. AI can help generate this plan, but you must review, validate, and refine it.\nThe Development Workflow Step 1: Create a Project Plan\nDefine clear project requirements and scope Ask AI to generate a plan based on your specifications Review the plan critically and request modifications Ensure the plan is detailed and unambiguous Step 2: Break Down into User Stories\nConvert the plan into user stories with clear acceptance criteria Divide large scope into smaller, manageable units Each unit becomes a mini-project that can be assigned to team members Estimate timelines for each unit (though be cautious of over-estimation) Step 3: Define Technology Stack\nClearly specify the technologies, frameworks, and tools to be used Instead of telling AI \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t implement this,\u0026rdquo; tell it \u0026ldquo;implement this way\u0026rdquo; Positive direction yields higher success rates than negative constraints Step 4: Detailed Requirements \u0026amp; Design\nWrite requirements with precision and clarity Collaborate with AI to create detailed specifications Define data models, API contracts, and system architecture Create design documents before implementation begins Step 5: Implementation \u0026amp; Verification\nImplement features according to the plan Use mob development approach (team works together on code) Verify all output code as a team Conduct code reviews and quality checks Step 6: Testing \u0026amp; Deployment\nMove through environments: Development (Dev) → Testing (QA) → User Acceptance Testing (UAT) → Production (Prod) Ensure quality gates at each stage Validate functionality before production release Critical Success Factors Create a Plan First - Don\u0026rsquo;t expect AI to handle everything. Always start with a clear plan. Review Regularly - Continuously review AI suggestions and outputs. High error rates are possible. You Are the Manager - Your value lies in code validation and project management, not in writing every line of code. Ask Clarifying Questions - Ensure AI understands your project context by asking it critical questions about requirements, architecture, and goals. Use Prompt Templates - Create structured prompts that include user context, user stories, and specific requirements to get clearer AI responses. Export Plans to Files - Have AI generate plans as files you can save, review, and modify. This creates a living document for future reference. Be Polite to AI - Maintain respectful communication with AI tools. Good rapport may help in future interactions (and it\u0026rsquo;s just good practice!). 2. Amazon Q Developer Demonstration What is Amazon Q Developer? Amazon Q Developer is an AI-powered assistant that transforms the software development lifecycle (SDLC) through agentic capabilities across multiple platforms:\nAWS Console - Helps with infrastructure and service configuration IDE (Integrated Development Environment) - Provides code generation and optimization suggestions CLI (Command Line Interface) - Assists with command generation and automation DevSecOps Platforms - Integrates security practices into the development workflow Key Capabilities Code Generation \u0026amp; Quality\nAccelerates code generation with AI-powered suggestions Improves code quality through intelligent recommendations Maintains seamless integration with existing workflows Understands complex codebases and suggests optimizations Documentation \u0026amp; Testing\nAutomatically generates comprehensive documentation Creates unit tests with minimal manual effort Significantly improves code maintainability and reliability Reduces boilerplate and repetitive coding tasks Intelligent Collaboration\nActs as an intelligent collaborator leveraging large language models Combines deep AWS service knowledge with coding expertise Helps developers accelerate development cycles Enhances code quality and strengthens security posture Automation Across Development Lifecycle\nAutomates routine tasks across the entire development lifecycle Reduces manual, repetitive work Allows developers to focus on higher-value, creative tasks Improves overall productivity and efficiency Best Practices for Using Amazon Q Developer Provide Clear Context - Give Q detailed information about your project, architecture, and requirements Use Specific Prompts - Instead of vague requests, provide specific, detailed prompts with examples Review Suggestions - Always review Q\u0026rsquo;s suggestions before implementing them Iterate and Refine - If the first suggestion isn\u0026rsquo;t perfect, refine your prompt and try again Leverage AWS Knowledge - Take advantage of Q\u0026rsquo;s deep understanding of AWS services and best practices 3. Kiro Demonstration What is Kiro? Kiro is an agentic IDE (Integrated Development Environment) developed by Amazon Web Services that bridges the gap between rapid AI-powered prototyping and production-ready software development. It\u0026rsquo;s currently in public preview.\nCore Philosophy Kiro embodies the principle that AI should enhance developer productivity while maintaining professional standards, clear structure, comprehensive testing, documentation, and long-term maintainability.\nKey Features Spec-Driven Development\nWhen you submit a requirement (e.g., \u0026ldquo;add a product rating system\u0026rdquo;), Kiro converts it into: User stories with clear acceptance criteria Design documentation Task lists and implementation plans Structured specifications before code generation Agent Hooks \u0026amp; Automation\nAutomatically triggers tasks based on events: File saves trigger documentation updates Commits trigger test generation Specific actions trigger performance optimization Reduces manual, repetitive work Steering \u0026amp; Project Context\nCreate steering files (markdown) to describe: Project structure and organization Coding standards and conventions Desired architecture patterns Team guidelines and best practices Helps Kiro understand your project context deeply Multi-File Analysis \u0026amp; Intent Understanding\nAnalyzes multiple files simultaneously Understands functional goals across the codebase Makes changes aligned with overall project objectives Goes beyond simple code completion VS Code Integration\nBuilt on VS Code\u0026rsquo;s open-source foundation Import settings, themes, and extensions from VS Code Familiar interface for existing VS Code users Seamless transition for developers Flexible AI Model Selection\nCurrently uses Claude Sonnet 4 as default \u0026ldquo;Auto\u0026rdquo; mode combines multiple models based on context Balance between quality and cost Flexibility to choose different models for different tasks Advantages of Using Kiro Increased Transparency \u0026amp; Control\nStart with specifications before code generation Review and validate specs before implementation Reduce hallucinated code or misaligned implementations Maintain clear traceability from requirements to code Reduced Boilerplate \u0026amp; Repetitive Tasks\nAgent hooks automate documentation generation Automatic unit test creation Automatic information updates Frees developers for higher-value work Security \u0026amp; Privacy\nMost code operations happen locally Data only sent externally with explicit permission Maintains control over sensitive information Extensibility \u0026amp; Flexibility\nIntegrates external tools via MCP (Model Context Protocol) Supports multiple AI models Not locked into a single AI environment Adaptable to different team workflows Limitations \u0026amp; Considerations Preview Status - Still in public preview; stability and features may change Complex Projects - May struggle with deep contextual understanding in highly complex projects Supervision Required - Users still need to oversee and validate AI decisions Future Pricing - Expected pricing tiers: Free: ~50 tasks/month Pro: ~1,000 tasks/month Pro+: ~3,000 tasks/month When to Use Kiro You want an AI + programming workflow that maintains professionalism and clear structure Building rapid prototypes but concerned about production sustainability Exploring how AI can become a true programming colleague, not just a code suggestion tool You need spec-driven development with automated documentation and testing Common Pitfalls When Using AI in Development 1. Expecting AI to Handle Everything Problem: Many developers expect AI to complete entire projects autonomously.\nSolution: Always create a plan first and review regularly. AI is a tool to enhance productivity, not replace developer judgment.\n2. High Error Rates Problem: AI can make mistakes, especially in complex scenarios.\nSolution: Implement regular review cycles. Validate all AI-generated code before deployment.\n3. Lack of Clear Requirements Problem: Vague or unclear requirements lead to vague AI outputs.\nSolution: Write requirements with precision. Collaborate with AI to create detailed specifications before implementation.\n4. Negative Constraints Instead of Positive Direction Problem: Telling AI \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t do this\u0026rdquo; is less effective than \u0026ldquo;do this.\u0026rdquo;\nSolution: Use positive, specific instructions. Higher success rates come from clear positive direction.\n5. Insufficient Project Context Problem: AI doesn\u0026rsquo;t understand your project\u0026rsquo;s unique requirements and constraints.\nSolution: Create steering files, provide detailed context, and ask AI critical questions about your project.\n6. Treating AI as a Manager Problem: Letting AI make all decisions about project direction and architecture.\nSolution: Remember: You are the manager. Your value lies in code validation and project oversight, not in writing every line of code.\nKey Takeaways AI is Your Assistant - Maintain control over project decisions and implementation direction\nPlan First, Code Second - Always create a comprehensive plan before implementation\nCollaboration Over Automation - AI should ask questions and collaborate, not just execute commands\nClear Requirements Matter - Precision in requirements leads to better AI outputs\nRegular Review is Essential - Don\u0026rsquo;t expect AI to be perfect; review and validate continuously\nYou Are the Code Manager - Your value is in validation and oversight, not in writing every line\nUse Structured Prompts - Templates with context, user stories, and requirements yield better results\nExport Plans to Files - Create living documents you can reference and modify\nPositive Direction Works Better - Tell AI what to do, not what to avoid\nExperience Matters - Use these tools hands-on to understand their capabilities and limitations\nRecommended Tools \u0026amp; Resources Amazon Q Developer - AI-powered development assistant integrated with AWS services Kiro IDE - Spec-driven development environment with AI collaboration AWS CodeWhisperer - Code generation and optimization tool MCP (Model Context Protocol) - Framework for integrating external tools and services Conclusion The AI-Driven Development Lifecycle represents a new paradigm in software engineering where AI and humans collaborate as equals. Success requires clear planning, regular review, precise requirements, and maintaining developer control over project direction. Tools like Amazon Q Developer and Kiro are enabling this new workflow, but they work best when developers understand their capabilities and limitations, and maintain their role as project managers and code validators.\n"

	"content": "Online Library – A Serverless Content Platform for Small Groups 1. Executive Summary The Online Library project aims to build a low-cost serverless platform for storing and distributing content (PDF/ePub) for a small user group (initially ~100 users, primarily students/labs needing controlled internal research-material sharing). The solution prioritizes security, content moderation (Admin Approval), and transparent, linear operating costs as it scales.\nThe architecture uses a fully AWS Serverless stack (Amplify, Cognito, API Gateway, Lambda, S3, CloudFront, DynamoDB).\nEstimated cost for the MVP (excluding Free Tier) is ≈ $9.80/month, with predictable scaling to 5,000–50,000 users.\n2. Problem Statement What’s the Problem? Documents and books are scattered; there is no secure content delivery system with access control; the process of adding or moderating user-generated content (UGC) is slow and has high friction.\nThe Solution: Build a serverless pipeline on AWS:\nUsers upload files via Presigned PUT URL to temporary S3; Admin approves → Lambda moves the file to a protected public folder; Readers access content via Signed GET URL (from CloudFront/CDN) to ensure speed and controlled access.\nBenefits and Return on Investment Business value: Centralized content; quality control through moderation; fast deployment with CI/CD. Technical benefits: Very low operating cost (≈ $9.80/month for MVP); scalable serverless architecture; secured content access. 3. Solution Architecture A. High level B. Request flow AWS Services Used Service Primary Role Specific Tasks Amplify Hosting CI/CD + FE Hosting Build \u0026amp; Deploy Next.js, domain management Cognito Authentication Sign-up/Login, JWT issuance, refresh tokens API Gateway API Entry Point Receive requests, validate JWT, route to Lambda Lambda Business Logic Handle upload/approval, generate signed URLs, write metadata S3 Object Storage Store original and approved files, served via CloudFront Signed URL CloudFront CDN Fast content delivery, blocks direct S3 access via OAC DynamoDB Database Store metadata (title, uploader, approval status) Route 53 DNS Domain mapping to Amplify, API Gateway, CloudFront CloudWatch Monitoring Lambda logs, anomaly alerts Search Simple search fields (titles, author) using DynamoDB GSIs.\nComponent Design User Upload: Presigned PUT to S3 uploads/. Admin Approval: Lambda copies file from uploads/ → public/books/ upon approval. Reader Security: CloudFront OAC prevents direct S3 access; reading occurs only through Signed URL generated by Lambda. Search Architecture Simple Search: Design GSI for title and author (example: GSI1: PK=TITLE#{normalizedTitle}, SK=BOOK#{bookId}; GSI2: PK=AUTHOR#{normalizedAuthor}, SK=BOOK#{bookId}). Add endpoint GET /search?title=...\u0026amp;author=... to query GSI instead of Scan. Admin Authorization Use Cognito User Groups with an Admins group. Admin JWT contains cognito:groups: [\u0026quot;Admins\u0026quot;]. Admin-specific Lambdas (exampleapproveBook, takedownBook) check this claim and return 403 Forbidden otherwise. JWT Authorizer (API Gateway HTTP API) handles authentication, while authorization logic is inside Lambda. 4. Technical Implementation Implementation Phases Design \u0026amp; IaC: Use CDK to define all stacks (Cognito, DDB, S3, Amplify, Lambda, API). Upload \u0026amp; Approval Flow: Implement Presigned PUT, metadata (status= PENDING), Admin approval logic. Reading Flow: Implement Signed GET, FE reader stream via CloudFront. Ops: CloudWatch logs, budget alerts, IAM hardening. Search: Add GSI for title, author, implement GET /search. Technical Requirements Entire infrastructure defined using CDK. API Gateway uses HTTP API for cost savings. Lambda (Python) handles business logic \u0026amp; DynamoDB/S3. S3 Bucket Policy must deny public access and allow only CloudFront OAC. 5. Timeline \u0026amp; Milestones Project Timeline Platform \u0026amp; Authentication (Week 1–2) Objective: Set up infrastructure and allow user login.\nBackend Tasks (CDK/DevOps): CDK/IaC stack for Cognito. CDK stack for DynamoDB (main table, no GSI yet). CDK stack for S3 (uploads, public, logs) + OAC. Deploy API Gateway (HTTP API) + a test Lambda. Frontend Tasks (Amplify): Configure Amplify Hosting + GitHub CI/CD. Integrate Amplify UI / Cognito SDK for: Sign-up, Email verification, Login, Forgot password. Milestone: git push automatically deploys FE. User can sign-up/login and obtain JWT. Upload \u0026amp; Approval Flow (Week 2–3) Objective: Allow authenticated users to upload files and Admins to approve them.\nBackend (Lambda/CDK): Implement createUploadUrl Lambda: Validate JWT. Create Presigned PUT URL to uploads/. Write metadata (status=PENDING). Implement approveBook: Validate Admin role. Copy S3 file uploads/ → public/books/. Update DynamoDB status (APPROVED). Frontend: Upload form (drag \u0026amp; drop). Upload via Presigned PUT. Admin dashboard with list of PENDING, button “Approve”. Reading \u0026amp; Search (Week 3–4) Objective: Allow reading \u0026amp; searching approved books.\nBackend: Implement getReadUrl: generate Signed GET URL (short TTL). Add GSI for title, author. Implement searchBooks. Frontend: Homepage: book list. Search bar → API searchBooks. Reader screen using the Signed URL (e.g., via react-pdf). Ops \u0026amp; Security (Week 5–6) Backend: S3 Event Notification for new uploads. Lambda validateMimeType: read magic bytes to verify PDF/ePub. Lambda takedownBook (Admin), deleteUpload (auto cleanup after 72h). DevOps: AWS Budget Alerts, CloudWatch Alarms. IAM least-privilege + CORS tightening. 6. Budget Estimation Budget comes from AWS Pricing Calculator.\nMonthly cost (strict, no Free Tier, ~100 users): ≈ $9.80/month.\n# AWS Service Region Monthly (USD) Notes 0 Amazon CloudFront Asia Pacific (Singapore) 0.86 10 GB data egress + 10 000 HTTPS requests 1 AWS Amplify Asia Pacific (Singapore) 1.31 100 build min + 0.5 GB storage + 2 GB served 2 Amazon API Gateway Asia Pacific (Singapore) 0.01 ~10 000 HTTP API calls/tháng 3 AWS Lambda Asia Pacific (Singapore) 0.00 128 MB RAM × 100 ms × 10 000 invokes 4 Amazon S3 (Standard) Asia Pacific (Singapore) 0.05 2 GB object storage for books/images 5 Data Transfer Asia Pacific (Singapore) 0.00 Included in CloudFront cost 6 DynamoDB (On-Demand) Asia Pacific (Singapore) 0.03 Light metadata table (0.1 GB, few reads/writes) 7 Amazon Cognito Asia Pacific (Singapore) 5.00 100 MAU, Advanced Security enabled 8 Amazon CloudWatch Asia Pacific (Singapore) 1.64 5 metrics + 0.1 GB logs/tháng 9 Amazon Route 53 Asia Pacific (Singapore) 0.90 1 Hosted Zone + DNS queries ≈ 9.80 USD / month No Free Tier applied Infrastructure Costs This cost model demonstrates the efficiency of serverless architecture: costs are primarily centered on the value delivered to the user (Cognito MAU), rather than paying for \u0026lsquo;idle servers\u0026rsquo;.\n7. Risk Assessment Risk Matrix Risk Impact Mitigation Cost spike due to sudden user growth High Limit MAU, cache metadata via CloudFront Abuse of uploads Medium Limit ≤ 50MB; auto-delete after 72h Fake/malicious file types Medium S3 Event → Lambda MIME validation Monitoring overload Low CloudWatch alerts, 14-day retention Mitigation Strategies cost: Set AWS Budget Alerts for CloudFront and Cognito. Be aware that Signed URLs have a short TTL and should not be cached publicly long-term; instead, cache metadata/API responses (book lists, details) on CloudFront for 3–5 minutes to reduce API load. Only generate Signed URLs when the user actually clicks to read (on-demand), do not pre-generate for the entire list. Upload: Limit file size to ≤ 50MB for MVP. (Can be increased to 200MB if needed, use multipart upload on the FE to avoid timeouts.) Apply Rate Limit/Throttling on API Gateway for endpoints that create Presigned URLs. Set up an S3 Lifecycle Policy to automatically delete unapproved files in uploads/ after 72h. Add Server-side Validation: S3 Event Notifications $\\to$ Lambda reads magic bytes (e.g., file-type library) to verify correct PDF/ePub; if incorrect, automatically delete and write REJECTED_INVALID_TYPE status to DynamoDB. Copyright (DMCA): Store Audit Log in DynamoDB: uploaderID, uploadTimestamp, adminApproverID, approvalTimestamp for traceability. Build a Takedown API (Admin only): update status to TAKEDOWN; optionally move the object from public/books/ to quarantine/books/ (do not delete completely) to preserve traces. Contingency Plans If costs exceed budget, enable Invite-Only mode to cap Cognito MAU and reduce load.\n8. Expected Outcomes Technical Improvements Fast and secure content delivery (CDN + Signed URL). Standard AWS Serverless architecture capable of scaling to 50,000 users without redesign. Fully automated CI/CD for both frontend \u0026amp; backend. Long-term Value A centralized content platform for structured book data. Continuous documentation of an end-to-end Serverless implementation. Room for future analytics (QuickSight) or AI/ML features. This system proves the ability to build a platform that securely, cost-effectively, and scalably easy by AWS Serverless services - that suitable to apply for small groups or communities.\n"

Environment \u0026amp; Config Use explicit environment variables: NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL for the frontend and API_URL for route handlers. Keep .env.example in sync whenever a new variable is introduced. Centralize URL construction in lib/api.ts to prevent duplication. Insight Server Components noticeably reduce latency when rendering detail pages. The App Router enforces a clear folder structure, making it easier to split new slices. When pointing to the mock API, fetch directly from Prism by swapping the base URL. Hands-On Labs Create a custom not-found.tsx with navigation CTAs. Implement a reusable getBook(id) helper for server components and tests.

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is like a mini version of the human brain when processing memory.\nLSTM Structure = 3 Gates + 1 Cell State 1. Forget Gate – Deciding What to Forget Decides what information to discard from the old state.\nFormula:\nf_t = σ(W_f · [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f) Brain analogy:\nUseless messages from someone who ghosted you → forget Formulas you use daily → keep 2. Input Gate – Deciding What to Remember Decides what new information to add to memory.\nFormulas:\ni_t = σ(W_i · [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_i)\rĈ_t = tanh(W_C · [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_C) Brain analogy:\nValuable information → store in long-term memory Irrelevant noise → discard immediately 3. Cell State Update – Long-term Memory Updates long-term memory by combining forget and input gates.\nFormula:\nC_t = f_t ⊙ C_{t-1} + i_t ⊙ Ĉ_t Where:\nf_t ⊙ C_{t-1} = what to keep from old memory i_t ⊙ Ĉ_t = what to add from new input 4. Output Gate – Deciding What to Output Decides which memory to use for current output.\nFormulas:\no_t = σ(W_o · [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_o)\rh_t = o_t ⊙ tanh(C_t) Brain analogy:\nWhen taking an NLP exam → recall LSTM formulas When talking to someone → recall conversation context When doing DevOps → recall AWS specs LSTM vs Human Brain Human Brain LSTM Long-term memory Cell State Filter out unnecessary information Forget Gate Accept new valuable information Input Gate Retrieve appropriate memory to respond Output Gate Learn from sequential experiences RNN backbone Don\u0026rsquo;t forget quickly Long-term dependencies What is a Gate? Gate = cognitive filter\nEach gate = a mechanism that decides \u0026ldquo;keep or discard\u0026rdquo;\nExample: When You Study NLP Forget Gate: \u0026ldquo;Do I still need to remember this outdated method?\u0026rdquo; → Discard if no Input Gate: \u0026ldquo;Is this new concept valuable?\u0026rdquo; → Store if yes Output Gate: \u0026ldquo;What knowledge do I need right now?\u0026rdquo; → Retrieve relevant parts Hidden State Limitations Hidden state doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a token limit, but has a capacity limit for effective memory.\nMathematical Perspective: Hidden state = fixed-size vector (e.g., 128, 256, 512 dimensions) Can process 10 tokens or 10,000 tokens → won\u0026rsquo;t crash Problem: can\u0026rsquo;t remember everything Why? Even with cell state, gradients weaken over many time steps Long-term dependencies get lost Tokens far from the start have weak influence on final output Solution: This is why we need Attention mechanism!\nThrottling in NLP Two Meanings of Throttling: 1. System-Level Throttling (API) Limiting request rate or token processing to:\nProtect GPU resources Distribute resources fairly Avoid server overload Control costs Examples:\nOpenAI GPT: 10 requests/second, 90k tokens/min Anthropic Claude: 20 requests/second HuggingFace: timeout if generation takes too long 2. Model-Level Throttling (Architecture) LSTM, Transformer, and Attention all have mechanisms to limit information processing at any given time:\n(A) LSTM Throttling → Forget Gate When sequence is too long:\nForget gate automatically \u0026ldquo;throttles\u0026rdquo; old information Only allows part of meaning to pass through Like network throttling: \u0026ldquo;overload → reduce bandwidth → drop packets\u0026rdquo; (B) Transformer Throttling → Context Window Limit\nBERT: 512 tokens GPT-3: 2048-4096 tokens GPT-4: 128k-1M tokens Claude 3.5 Sonnet: 200k-1M tokens When input exceeds limit:\nModel cuts data Or refuses to process Or downgrades attention quality (C) Attention Throttling → Sparse Attention In long-context models (Longformer, BigBird, Mistral):\nCan\u0026rsquo;t compute full n² attention Only attend to important regions (local attention) Or global tokens Or sliding window (D) Token Generation Throttling Some decoders will:\nSlow down token generation Limit sampling Apply temperature control Cut beam search When input is noisy or uncertain, this acts like a brake: \u0026ldquo;Not sure → slow down generation → increase quality\u0026rdquo;\nSummary LSTM is not just a model — it\u0026rsquo;s a computational mimicry of how human memory works.

Key Insights ✅ Attention is learned: W_q, W_k, W_v are trainable parameters ✅ Position-free: No sequential dependencies - can attend across any distance ✅ Interpretable: Can visualize which words attend to which ✅ Efficient: Uses only matrix operations (GPU-friendly)\nNext Steps Now that we understand scaled dot-product attention, we\u0026rsquo;ll explore:\nSelf-attention (query=key=value) Masked attention (decoder only sees past) Encoder-decoder attention (cross-lingual connections) Multi-head attention in detail (learning multiple patterns) "

	"content": "Tuning Guide for AMD-based Amazon EC2 Instances By Suyash Nadkarni and Dylan Souvage — September 12, 2025 · Amazon EC2 · Best Practices · Expert (400) · Technical How-to\nAs organizations move more mission-critical workloads to the cloud, optimizing price-performance becomes essential. Amazon EC2 instances powered by AMD EPYC processors offer high core density, large memory bandwidth, and hardware-enabled security features, making them a strong fit for compute-, memory-, or I/O-intensive applications. This post explains how to choose the right AMD-based Amazon EC2 instance family and describes tuning techniques that improve workload efficiency—whether you run simulations, large-scale analytics, or inference jobs.\nAmazon EC2 offers AMD options across multiple EPYC generations. We focus on optimization strategies for 3rd- and 4th-generation processors, which are designed for compute- and memory-heavy workloads.\nGeneration 3 (M6a, R6a, C6a, Hpc6a): Balanced compute, memory, and storage—ideal for analytics, web servers, and HPC. Generation 4 (M7a, R7a, C7a, Hpc7a): Up to 50% more performance than prior AMD generations, with AVX-512 support, DDR5 memory, and Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT) disabled so each vCPU maps to a physical core for better isolation. Choose the right AMD EPYC instance family Selecting the correct AMD EPYC instance begins with understanding how your application consumes compute, memory, storage, and network resources. Each family is tailored to a specific profile.\nCompute-intensive workloads — large-scale numerical calculations, simulations, or encoding that require high CPU throughput and advanced instruction support.\nRecommended: C7a, Hpc7a, C6a, Hpc6a Use cases: scientific computing, financial modeling, media transcoding, encryption, ML inference Big Data \u0026amp; Analytics — large data processing and analytics that benefit from high memory bandwidth and balanced compute-to-memory ratios.\nRecommended: R7a, M7a, R6a, M6a Use cases: stream processing, real-time analytics, BI tools, distributed caching Database workloads — relational, NoSQL, or in-memory databases that need consistent memory performance and high I/O throughput.\nRecommended: R7a, M7a, R6a, M6a Use cases: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis Web and application servers — variable request workloads that need balanced compute, memory, and networking.\nRecommended: C7a, M7a, C6a, M6a Use cases: web servers, CMS platforms, e-commerce sites, API endpoints AI/ML on CPU — ML tasks that do not require GPUs (such as inference or preprocessing).\nRecommended: C7a, Hpc7a, M7a Use cases: fluid dynamics, genomics, seismic analysis, engineering simulations Matching the instance to the workload provides predictable performance and cost efficiency. Services like Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling and AWS Compute Optimizer can help with sizing and continuous scaling decisions.\nOptimize AMD EPYC-based Amazon EC2 instances 4th-generation AMD EPYC processors use a modular “chiplet” architecture. Each CPU is composed of multiple Core Complex Dies (CCD), and each CCD contains one or more core complexes (CCX). A CCX bundles up to eight physical cores; each core includes 1 MB of private L2 cache, and the eight cores share 32 MB of L3 cache. The CCDs connect to a central I/O die that manages memory and inter-chip links.\n(Die diagram: Zen 4 CPU with eight cores per die)\nThis modular design lets instances such as m7a.24xlarge and m7a.48xlarge expose very high core counts—up to 96 physical cores per socket. For example:\nm7a.24xlarge delivers 96 physical cores from a single socket. m7a.48xlarge spans two sockets for 192 physical cores. Understanding how EC2 instance sizes map to the underlying processor layout helps you optimize cache locality. Workloads that rely on shared-memory access or thread synchronization—such as HPC or in-memory databases—benefit from choosing sizes that minimize cross-socket communication and maximize L3-cache locality.\n(BLOCK diagram: EPYC chiplet layout)\n4th-generation AMD EPYC instances run with SMT disabled, so each vCPU maps directly to a physical core. This eliminates resource sharing between sibling threads (execution units, caches, etc.) and can reduce intra-core interference. The result is lower jitter and more consistent throughput for HPC, ML inference, and transactional database workloads.\nCPU optimizations Tools like htop reveal CPU usage patterns, system load averages, and per-process resource consumption. Evaluate CPU utilization in the context of workload requirements. Sustained utilization near 100% may indicate the workload is CPU-bound. Before resizing instances, enabling Auto Scaling, or switching families, analyze tuning opportunities that improve performance without infrastructure changes. Load averages that frequently exceed the vCPU count also signal saturation.\nUse the L3 cache effectively L3 cache is a fast shared cache accessible by a group of cores. On AMD-based EC2 instances, cores are grouped into L3 cache slices shared by a subset of cores on the same socket. Threads scheduled within the same slice access shared data more efficiently, reducing memory latency. On 4th-generation instances such as m7a.2xlarge or r7a.2xlarge, all vCPUs often map to cores within the same L3 slice. For larger sizes (m7a.8xlarge and above), thread pinning—assigning threads to specific physical cores—helps maintain locality and lowers performance variability.\ntaskset -c 0-3 ./your_application Use lscpu or lstopo to inspect the CPU topology and group related threads onto cores that share L3 cache.\nOptimize Docker containers By default, container runtimes such as Docker allow the OS scheduler to move containers across any CPU core. That flexibility can introduce variability when containers bounce between cores that do not share cache. Pin containers to specific cores with --cpuset-cpus to improve cache efficiency and reduce jitter:\ndocker run --cpuset-cpus=\u0026#34;1,3\u0026#34; my-container Choose cores based on the CPU topology so that containers stay on cores sharing the same L3 slice.\nSet the CPU frequency governor Some operating systems dynamically scale CPU frequency to save power via the CPU frequency governor. For latency-sensitive or compute-bound workloads, switch to performance mode so the CPU runs at max frequency under load:\nsudo cpupower frequency-set -g performance Benchmark with other governors (such as ondemand or schedutil) to confirm the performance mode delivers measurable gains without excessive power usage.\nUse architecture-specific compiler flags When compiling C/C++ applications, architecture flags such as -march=znverX enable AMD EPYC–specific optimizations (vectorization, floating-point throughput, etc.). Ensure that the compiler and target instance generation match the flag; binaries built with -march=znver4 will raise SIGILL on older instances like M5a.\nAMD EPYC generation -march flag Minimum GCC version Minimum LLVM/Clang version Generation 4 (M7a) znver4 GCC 12 Clang 15 Generation 3 (M6a) znver3 GCC 11 Clang 13 Generation 2 (M5a) znver2 GCC 9 Clang 11 Supported flags (GCC 11+ / Clang 13+):\nGeneration 4 (M7a, R7a, C7a, Hpc7a): -march=znver4 Generation 3 (M6a, R6a, C6a): -march=znver3 Generation 2 (M5a, R5a, C5a): -march=znver2 When to enable AVX-512 and VNNI 4th-generation AMD EPYC instances support SIMD instruction sets such as AVX2, AVX-512, and VNNI. These can boost throughput for vector-heavy workloads (ML inference, image processing, scientific simulations). Only enable them on generations that support the instructions to avoid SIGILL errors on older hardware.\ngcc -mavx2 -mavx512f -O2 your_program.c -o your_program\r# Investigate vectorization:\r-ftree-vectorizer-verbose=2 -fopt-info-vec-missed AMD Optimizing CPU Libraries (AOCL) AMD Optimizing CPU Libraries (AOCL) provide tuned math routines—vector, scalar, RNG, FFT, BLAS, LAPACK, and more—built specifically for AMD EPYC processors. Link your application against AOCL to leverage hardware optimizations without rewriting code.\nConfigure AOCL export AOCL_ROOT=/path/to/aocl\rgcc -I$AOCL_ROOT/include -L$AOCL_ROOT/lib -lamdlibm -lm your_program.c -o your_program\r# Vector math\rgcc -lamdlibm -fveclib=AMDLIBM -lm your_program.c -o your_program\r# Faster scalar math\rgcc -lamdlibm -fsclrlib=AMDLIBM -lamdlibmfast -lm your_program.c -o your_program\rexport AOCL_PROFILE=1\r./your_program Profiling generates aocl_profile_report.txt, which lists call counts, execution time, and thread usage so you can focus optimization on the hottest routines.\nConclusion We showed how to match AMD-based Amazon EC2 instance families to workload characteristics and how to apply tuning techniques focused on CPU utilization, thread placement, cache efficiency, and math libraries. These practices are especially valuable for CPU-bound or latency-sensitive workloads where consistent performance is critical.\nReady to get started?

Does not support transitive routing or overlapping CIDRs. VPC Peering Limitations:\nNo transitive peering No overlapping CIDR blocks Limited to 125 peering connections per VPC Cross-region peering supported AWS Transit Gateway (TGW) Acts as a hub to connect multiple VPCs and on-prem networks, simplifying complex mesh topologies. TGW Attachments associate subnets in specific AZs with a TGW. All subnets within the same AZ can reach the TGW once attached. Transit Gateway Benefits:\nCentralized connectivity hub Simplified network architecture Scalable to thousands of VPCs Supports inter-region peering VPN \u0026amp; Direct Connect Site-to-Site VPN Establishes a secure IPSec connection between an on-premises data center and AWS VPC. Consists of: Virtual Private Gateway (VGW): AWS-managed, multi-AZ endpoints. Customer Gateway (CGW): Customer-managed device or software appliance. AWS Direct Connect Provides a dedicated private network connection between an on-prem data center and AWS. Typical latency: 20–30 ms. In Vietnam, available through Hosted Connections (via partners). Bandwidth is adjustable.

New instances automatically register; terminated instances deregister automatically. Auto Scaling Best Practices:\nUse multiple AZs for high availability Set appropriate cooldown periods Monitor CloudWatch metrics Use lifecycle hooks for custom actions Test scaling policies before production EC2 Pricing Options On-Demand: Pay per hour/second. Most expensive but flexible. Reserved Instances: 1- or 3-year commitment for discount; tied to specific instance type/family. Savings Plans: 1- or 3-year commitment; flexible across instance families. Spot Instances: Use spare capacity at up to 90% discount; can be terminated with 2-minute notice. Combine multiple pricing models within an Auto Scaling Group for cost optimization.\nPricing Comparison:\nModel Discount Flexibility Commitment On-Demand 0% High None Reserved 40-60% Low 1-3 years Savings Plans 40-60% Medium 1-3 years Spot 50-90% Low None Hands-On Labs Lab 09 – AWS Support Plans AWS Support Packages → 09-01 Types of Support Requests → 09-02 Change Support Package → 09-03 Manage Support Requests → 09-04 "

Understanding each is crucial.\nType 1: Self-Attention (Encoder) Definition: Each position attends to all positions in the same sequence.\nUse Case: In the encoder, we want each word to understand its context by looking at all other words.\nExample:\nSentence: \u0026#34;The cat sat on the mat\u0026#34;\rFor word \u0026#34;cat\u0026#34;:\r- Attend to \u0026#34;The\u0026#34;: 0.15 (article)\r- Attend to \u0026#34;cat\u0026#34;: 0.40 (itself)\r- Attend to \u0026#34;sat\u0026#34;: 0.20 (verb)\r- Attend to \u0026#34;on\u0026#34;: 0.10\r- Attend to \u0026#34;the\u0026#34;: 0.08\r- Attend to \u0026#34;mat\u0026#34;: 0.07\rResult: \u0026#34;cat\u0026#34; context = weighted combination of all 6 words Why useful:\nCaptures full sentence context Can identify relationships (subject-verb, adjective-noun, etc.) Each word gets information from entire sentence Implementation:\nQ = K = V = Input (same source!)\rattention(Q, K, V) = softmax(Q×K^T / √d_k) × V Since Q, K, V come from the same place, it\u0026rsquo;s called \u0026ldquo;self-attention\u0026rdquo;.\nType 2: Masked Self-Attention (Decoder) Problem: During training, if the decoder can \u0026ldquo;see\u0026rdquo; future words, it cheats!\nExample - The Problem:\nTask: Translate \u0026#34;Je suis heureux\u0026#34; → \u0026#34;I am happy\u0026#34;\rTraining:\rStep 1: Predict \u0026#34;am\u0026#34; using... \u0026#34;am\u0026#34; (it can see the answer!)\rStep 2: Predict \u0026#34;happy\u0026#34; using \u0026#34;I am happy\u0026#34; (knows the answer!)\rStep 3: Predict \u0026#34;happy\u0026#34; is done (cheating!)\rResult: Model trains perfectly but fails at test time! Solution: Mask (hide) future positions during self-attention.\nMasked Self-Attention:\nInstead of: We do:\r[0.30, 0.33, 0.37] [0.30, -∞, -∞]\r[0.26, 0.37, 0.37] → [0.26, 0.37, -∞]\r[0.25, 0.36, 0.39] [0.25, 0.36, 0.39]\rAfter softmax:\r[1.00, 0.00, 0.00]\r[0.30, 0.70, 0.00]\r[0.25, 0.36, 0.39]\r(normalized) Mask Matrix:\nMask = [1, 0, 0]\r[1, 1, 0]\r[1, 1, 1]\rOr: -∞ for masked positions Effect:\nPosition 0: Attends to position 0 only\rPosition 1: Attends to positions 0, 1 only\rPosition 2: Attends to positions 0, 1, 2\rDecoder can only use past information! Why this works:\nDuring training, can use autoregressive generation During inference, generates word-by-word naturally Prevents the model from \u0026ldquo;seeing the answer\u0026rdquo; Type 3: Encoder-Decoder Attention Purpose: Decoder attends to encoder output.\nExample:\nEncoder processes: \u0026#34;Je suis heureux\u0026#34; (French)\rProduces: Context vectors C\rDecoder processes: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; (empty start)\rFor generating first word:\r- Query: from decoder (what should I translate?)\r- Key, Value: from encoder (what French words should I look at?)\rResult: Decoder attends to French words to generate English Key Difference from Self-Attention:\nSelf-Attention: Encoder-Decoder:\rQ, K, V all from input Q from decoder\rSame sequence K, V from encoder\rAttends within self Attends to other sequence Use Cases:\nDecoder looking back at encoder output Allows translation: French → English Allows summarization: Document → Summary Generally useful for seq2seq tasks Comparison: All Three Types Type Q Source K, V Source Purpose Self-Attention Input Input Understand context within same sequence Masked Self-Attention Input Input (masked future) Autoregressive generation, prevent cheating Encoder-Decoder Decoder Encoder Cross-sequence understanding Masked Attention in Detail The Math Before masking:\nAttention = softmax(Q×K^T / √d_k) × V With masking:\nScores = Q×K^T / √d_k\rMask matrix M:\rM[i,j] = 0 if j \u0026lt;= i (allowed)\rM[i,j] = -∞ if j \u0026gt; i (mask future)\rMasked_scores = Scores + M\rAttention = softmax(Masked_scores) × V Example with Real Numbers Original attention scores (3×3):\n[0.1, 0.2, 0.3]\r[0.4, 0.5, 0.6]\r[0.7, 0.8, 0.9] Mask matrix:\n[0, -∞, -∞]\r[0, 0, -∞]\r[0, 0, 0] After adding mask:\n[0.1, -∞, -∞]\r[0.4, 0.5, -∞]\r[0.7, 0.8, 0.9] After softmax (applying exp and normalize):\nexp(0.1) / exp(0.1) = 1.0, softmax([0.1]) = [1.0]\rSo:\rRow 0: [1.0, 0, 0]\rexp(0.4) ≈ 1.49, exp(0.5) ≈ 1.65\rRow 1: [1.49/(1.49+1.65), 1.65/(1.49+1.65), 0] ≈ [0.47, 0.53, 0]\rRow 2: softmax([0.7, 0.8, 0.9]) (all allowed) Final attention weights:\n[1.0, 0.0, 0.0]\r[0.47, 0.53, 0.0]\r[0.25, 0.33, 0.42] Key insight: Position 2 can only use information from positions 0, 1, 2 (not future)\nComplete Transformer Attention Flow INPUT: \u0026#34;Je suis heureux\u0026#34;\r↓\rENCODER LAYERS (repeat 6 times):\r├─ Self-Attention: Each French word attends to all French words\r├─ Feed-Forward\r→ Output: C (French context vectors)\rDECODER LAYERS (repeat 6 times):\r├─ Masked Self-Attention: Each generated word attends to previous words\r├─ Encoder-Decoder Attention: Generated word attends to French context\r├─ Feed-Forward\r→ Output: Logits for next word prediction\rOUTPUT: \u0026#34;I am happy\u0026#34; Key Insights ✅ Self-Attention: Bidirectional understanding (encoder) ✅ Masked Attention: Unidirectional generation (decoder) ✅ Encoder-Decoder: Cross-sequence transfer ✅ Masking prevents cheating: Model can\u0026rsquo;t use future information\nWhy Not Always Use All Three? BERT (Encoder-only): Uses only self-attention (bidirectional, good for classification) GPT (Decoder-only): Uses only masked self-attention (autoregressive, good for generation) T5 (Full): Uses all three (balanced, good for seq2seq tasks) Next: Implementation Now that we understand the three attention types, we\u0026rsquo;ll see how to implement them in code!\n"

Data Scale Matters Pre-trained on the C4 corpus (~800 GB) vs. Wikipedia (~13 GB). Larger, cleaner corpora improve downstream generalization. Multitask Benefits Shared encoder-decoder improves transfer between tasks. Better low-resource performance thanks to cross-task signals. Practical Notes Control output length with decoder max_length and repetition penalty. For QA, ensure prompts clearly separate question and context. Mixed-task fine-tuning: balance batches to avoid task dominance. Practice Targets for Today Draft prompts for your QA and summarization tasks. Decide model size vs. GPU budget (T5-small/base/large). Plan a multitask mix (ratio per task) for fine-tuning. "

Schemathesis explores random scenarios (happy paths, edge cases, missing fields). Ensures the backend doesn’t break the schema when the frontend switches to the real API. Benefits Eliminates the need to handcraft complex test cases. Reduces mismatch risk after refactors. Acts as a quality gate inside the CI pipeline. Mistakes \u0026amp; Fixes Mistake Root Cause Fix Added both error.tsx and not-found.tsx Redundant handling Keep only not-found.tsx Used --base-url in Schemathesis Wrong CLI option Use the correct --url flag Timeout on /openapi.json CORS or slow resp Point Schemathesis to the YAML file Over-engineered backend Too many files early Start simple and refactor later Validated Workflow 1. Define Contract (OpenAPI)\r2. Mock API (Prism)\r3. Build Frontend with mock data\r4. Implement Backend according to the spec\r5. Switch to the real API\r6. Contract Testing (Schemathesis) Enables frontend and backend teams to work in parallel. Reduces conflicts, accelerates demos, and keeps quality stable. Key Insights Contract-first development keeps specs aligned and shrinks integration bugs. Vertical slices make it possible to release in increments and gather early feedback. Automation (Prism, Schemathesis) cuts manual testing effort. Start simple and refactor gradually as scope grows. Hands-On Labs Run Schemathesis with the latest spec and capture the results. Refresh the README workflow so the whole team can follow it. Prepare the backlog for the next vertical slice based on demo feedback. "

A model that outputs common words will score well.\nModified BLEU (Better) Key Change: After matching a word, exhaust it from references\nSame Example:\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rdquo; (first) → matches → exhaust \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rdquo; from references → count = 1 \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rdquo; (second) → no match left → count = 1 \u0026ldquo;am\u0026rdquo; → matches → exhaust \u0026ldquo;am\u0026rdquo; → count = 2 \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rdquo; (third) → no match left → count = 2 Result: 2/4 = 0.5 (more realistic!)\nBLEU Limitations ❌ Doesn\u0026rsquo;t consider semantic meaning\nOnly checks word matches ❌ Doesn\u0026rsquo;t consider sentence structure\n\u0026ldquo;Ate I was hungry because\u0026rdquo; vs \u0026ldquo;I ate because I was hungry\u0026rdquo; Both get same score! ✅ Still most widely adopted metric despite limitations\nROUGE Score – Recall-Based Evaluation ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation)\nBLEU vs ROUGE Metric Focus Calculation BLEU Precision How many candidate words in reference? ROUGE Recall How many reference words in candidate? Calculating ROUGE-N Score Example:\nCandidate: \u0026ldquo;I I am I\u0026rdquo; Reference 1: \u0026ldquo;Younes said I am hungry\u0026rdquo; (5 words) Reference 2: \u0026ldquo;He said I\u0026rsquo;m hungry\u0026rdquo; (5 words) Process for Reference 1:\n\u0026ldquo;Younes\u0026rdquo; → no match → count = 0 \u0026ldquo;said\u0026rdquo; → no match → count = 0 \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rdquo; → match → count = 1 \u0026ldquo;am\u0026rdquo; → match → count = 2 \u0026ldquo;hungry\u0026rdquo; → no match → count = 2 ROUGE score for Ref 1: 2/5 = 0.4\nIf multiple references: Calculate for each, take maximum\nF1 Score – Combining BLEU and ROUGE Since BLEU = precision and ROUGE = recall, we can calculate F1 score:\nFormula:\nF1 = 2 × (Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall)\rF1 = 2 × (BLEU × ROUGE) / (BLEU + ROUGE) Example:\nBLEU = 0.5 ROUGE = 0.4 F1 = 2 × (0.5 × 0.4) / (0.5 + 0.4) = 4/9 ≈ 0.44 Beam Search Decoding Problem: Taking the highest probability word at each step doesn\u0026rsquo;t guarantee best overall sequence\nSolution: Beam search finds most likely sequences over a fixed window\nHow Beam Search Works Beam Width (B): Number of sequences to keep at each step\nProcess: Step 1: Start with SOS token Get probabilities for first word:\nI: 0.5 am: 0.4 hungry: 0.1 Keep top B=2: \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;am\u0026rdquo;\nStep 2: Calculate Conditional Probabilities For \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rdquo;:\nI am: 0.5 × 0.5 = 0.25 I I: 0.5 × 0.1 = 0.05 For \u0026ldquo;am\u0026rdquo;:\nam I: 0.4 × 0.7 = 0.28 am hungry: 0.4 × 0.2 = 0.08 Keep top B=2: \u0026ldquo;am I\u0026rdquo; (0.28) and \u0026ldquo;I am\u0026rdquo; (0.25)\nStep 3: Repeat Continue until all B sequences reach EOS token\nStep 4: Select Best Choose sequence with highest overall probability\nBeam Search Characteristics Advantages:\nBetter than greedy decoding (B=1) Finds globally better sequences Widely used in production Disadvantages:\nMemory intensive (store B sequences) Computationally expensive (run model B times per step) Penalizes long sequences (product of many probabilities) Solution for Long Sequences: Normalize by length: divide probability by number of words\nMinimum Bayes Risk (MBR) Decoding Concept: Generate multiple samples and find consensus\nMBR Process: Step 1: Generate Multiple Samples Create ~30 random samples from the model\nStep 2: Compare All Pairs For each sample, compare against all others using similarity metric (e.g., ROUGE)\nStep 3: Calculate Average Similarity For each candidate, compute average similarity with all other candidates\nStep 4: Select Best Choose the sample with highest average similarity (lowest risk)\nMBR Formula E* = argmax_E [ average ROUGE(E, E\u0026#39;) for all E\u0026#39; ] Where:\nE = candidate translation E\u0026rsquo; = all other candidates Goal: Find E that maximizes average ROUGE with every E' MBR Example (4 Candidates) Step 1: Calculate pairwise ROUGE scores\nROUGE(C1, C2), ROUGE(C1, C3), ROUGE(C1, C4) Average = R1 Step 2: Repeat for C2, C3, C4\nGet R2, R3, R4 Step 3: Select highest\nChoose candidate with max(R1, R2, R3, R4) MBR Characteristics Advantages:\nMore contextually accurate than random sampling Finds consensus translation Can outperform beam search Disadvantages:\nRequires generating many samples (expensive) Requires O(n²) comparisons When to Use:\nWhen you need high-quality translation When computational cost is acceptable When beam search outputs are inconsistent Summary: Decoding Strategies Method Description Pros Cons Greedy Pick highest prob at each step Fast, simple Suboptimal sequences Beam Search Keep top-B sequences Better quality Memory + compute cost Random Sampling Sample from distribution Diverse outputs Inconsistent quality MBR Consensus from samples High quality Very expensive Evaluation Metrics Summary Metric Type Focus Best For BLEU Precision Candidate → Reference General MT ROUGE Recall Reference → Candidate Summarization F1 Harmonic Mean Both precision \u0026amp; recall Balanced view Critical Note: All these metrics:\n❌ Don\u0026rsquo;t consider semantics ❌ Don\u0026rsquo;t consider sentence structure ✅ Only count n-gram matches Modern Alternative: Use neural metrics or human evaluation for critical applications!\n"

Unfreeze progressively (top -\u0026gt; bottom) if accuracy plateaus. Add a task-specific head (classification, span QA, seq2seq) and start there. Hyperparameter Basics Learning rate: 1e-5 to 3e-5 for full encoder; slightly higher if mostly frozen. Warmup steps: ~5% to 10% of total steps to stabilize early training. Max sequence length: match task; chunk long docs for QA. Evaluation Loop Track loss + task metrics (EM/F1 for QA, ROUGE for summarization, accuracy/F1 for classification). Early stop on dev set; keep best checkpoint, not just last. Compare feature-based baseline vs. full fine-tune for a small subset. Deployment Considerations Distill or quantize for latency if accuracy holds. Cache tokenizer and truncation rules to avoid drift between train and serve. Log prompts/inputs to debug closed-book vs. context-based behaviors. Practice Targets for Today Run (or plan) a small grid: learning rate, freezing strategy, max length. Evaluate on a held-out set and record EM/F1 or ROUGE. Decide post-training steps: distillation, quantization, or caching. "

Participants build Hello World functions (Node.js/Python), add parameters, and deploy a sample in-app purchase suggestion API. Focus on delivering quickly without server management, cost awareness, and solid operational practices.\nAgenda Serverless foundations: why Lambda, when to choose it, regional considerations. Hello World fast path: create/test Lambda from console (Node.js/Python); adjust memory/timeouts. Handling inputs: events, query strings, request body parsing, common error patterns. API Gateway integration: create resources/methods, map to Lambda, deploy stages, test via curl/Postman. Sample app: in-app purchase recommender (purchased vs. available items). Cost \u0026amp; ops: memory tuning, cold-start awareness, logging, basic error handling. Next steps: custom runtimes, serverless frameworks, edge deployments. What You’ll Build Two Lambda functions (Node.js and Python) with parameterized responses. One Lambda-backed REST endpoint via API Gateway (GET/POST). A simple business-logic function (in-app purchase suggestions) returning JSON. Prerequisites AWS account with console access. Basic familiarity with JavaScript or Python. curl or Postman for API testing.

Please do not copy verbatim for your report, including this warning.\nHere, you can freely share your personal opinions about your experience participating in the First Cloud Journey program. This will help the FCJ team improve any shortcomings based on the following aspects:\nOverall Evaluation 1. Working Environment\nThe working environment is very friendly and open. FCJ members are always willing to help whenever I encounter difficulties, even outside working hours. The workspace is tidy and comfortable, helping me focus better. However, I think it would be nice to have more social gatherings or team bonding activities to strengthen relationships.\n2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin\nThe mentor provides very detailed guidance, explains clearly when I don’t understand, and always encourages me to ask questions. The admin team supports administrative tasks, provides necessary documents, and creates favorable conditions for me to work effectively. I especially appreciate that the mentor allows me to try and solve problems myself instead of just giving the answer.\n3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major\nThe tasks I was assigned align well with the knowledge I learned at university, while also introducing me to new areas I had never encountered before. This allowed me to both strengthen my foundational knowledge and gain practical skills.\n4. Learning \u0026amp; Skill Development Opportunities\nDuring the internship, I learned many new skills such as using project management tools, teamwork skills, and professional communication in a corporate environment. The mentor also shared valuable real-world experiences that helped me better plan my career path.\n5. Company Culture \u0026amp; Team Spirit\nThe company culture is very positive: everyone respects each other, works seriously but still keeps things enjoyable. When there are urgent projects, everyone works together and supports one another regardless of their position. This made me feel like a real part of the team, even as an intern.\n6. Internship Policies / Benefits\nThe company provides an internship allowance and offers flexible working hours when needed. In addition, having the opportunity to join internal training sessions is a big plus.\nAdditional Questions What did you find most satisfying during your internship?
