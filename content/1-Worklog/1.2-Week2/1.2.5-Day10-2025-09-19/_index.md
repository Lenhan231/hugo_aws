# **Lecture Notes**

## Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)

### Overview

- A fully managed service distributing traffic across multiple targets (EC2, containers, etc.).  
- Supports HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, TLS.  
- Can be deployed in public or private subnets.  
- Provides DNS names; only NLB supports static IPs.  
- Includes health checks and access logs (to S3).  
- Supports sticky sessions (session affinity).  
- Types: **Application**, **Network**, **Classic**, and **Gateway** Load Balancer.

### Application Load Balancer (ALB)

- Operates at Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS).  
- Supports path-based routing (e.g., /mobile vs /desktop).  
- Targets: EC2, Lambda, IP addresses, containers (ECS/EKS).

**ALB Features:**

- Host-based routing
- Path-based routing
- HTTP header-based routing
- Query string parameter-based routing
- WebSocket support
- HTTP/2 support

### Network Load Balancer (NLB)

- Operates at Layer 4 (TCP/TLS).  
- Supports static IPs and handles millions of requests per second.  
- Targets: EC2, IP addresses, containers (ECS/EKS).

**NLB Features:**

- Ultra-low latency
- Static IP addresses
- Preserve source IP
- Long-lived TCP connections
- TLS termination

### Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)

- Operates at Layer 3 (IP packets).  
- Uses the GENEVE protocol on port 6081.  
- Routes traffic to virtual appliances such as firewalls or monitoring tools.
