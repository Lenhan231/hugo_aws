# **Morphology – Structure of Words**

## Examples:
- **Prefixes:** un-, re-, pre-
- **Suffixes:** -ing, -ed, -ness
- **Roots/stems:** run, happy, form

## NLP Relevance:

### Stemming
Reducing words to their stem (running → run, walked → walk)

### Lemmatization
Converting words to their base form (better → good, went → go)

### Tokenization
Breaking text into individual words or tokens

### Vocabulary Building
Creating feature sets for Bag of Words models
