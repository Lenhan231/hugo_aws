**Natural Language Processing (NLP)** is a field of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to **understand, interpret, generate, and interact** with human language.

NLP integrates **computational linguistics**, **machine learning**, and **deep learning** to process large-scale text and speech data.

## Typical NLP Tasks:
- Text classification
- Sentiment analysis
- Named Entity Recognition (NER)

# **Phonetics – The Sounds of Human Speech**

**Phonetics** studies the *physical* properties of speech sounds.

## Three Branches:

### Articulatory Phonetics
How sounds are produced (tongue, lips, vocal folds…)

### Acoustic Phonetics
Physical sound properties (frequency, amplitude, duration)

### Auditory Phonetics
How humans perceive sounds

## NLP Relevance:
Used in speech recognition, speech synthesis (TTS), acoustic modeling.
