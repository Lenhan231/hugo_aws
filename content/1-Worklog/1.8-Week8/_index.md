## Week 8 Overview

This week focuses on Natural Language Processing (NLP) foundations, covering the linguistic and computational aspects essential for building NLP systems. We explore the Bag of Words approach and the core linguistic components that form the backbone of modern text processing.

### Key Topics

- What is Natural Language Processing?
- Core linguistic components (Phonetics, Phonology, Morphology, Syntax, Semantics, Pragmatics)
- Text preprocessing and tokenization
- Bag of Words (BoW) model fundamentals
- NLP applications and real-world use cases
- Intent recognition and semantic search

### Hands-on Labs

- Text tokenization and normalization
- Building a Bag of Words representation
- Morphological analysis and stemming/lemmatization
- Implementing basic text classification with BoW
- Semantic similarity measurements
