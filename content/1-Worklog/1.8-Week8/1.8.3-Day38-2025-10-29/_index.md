# **Semantics – Meaning of Words and Sentences**

**Semantics** focuses on meaning **independent of external context**.

## It Includes:
- **Lexical semantics:** Word meaning
- **Compositional semantics:** Sentence meaning
- **Synonymy / antonymy:** Similar/opposite words
- **Hypernymy / hyponymy:** General/specific relationships

## NLP Relevance:
- **Word embeddings:** Representing words as dense vectors
- **Similarity measures:** Computing word/document similarity
- **Semantic search:** Finding relevant content by meaning
- **Text classification:** Categorizing documents by content
